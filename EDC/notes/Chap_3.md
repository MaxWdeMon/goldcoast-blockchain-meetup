CHAPTER 3
==========
Ethereum clients - full node, remote client, wallet

FULL NODE
——————
Full Node - parity (rust), geth (go)
Very hardware intensive
Can communicate to blockchain without intermediary
Takes ages to synch on main net. Can be sped up using fast sync which skips validation until synced to tip of blockchain.
JSON-RPC API

REMOTE CLIENT
—————————
Do not store full blockchain
Connect to full node run elsewhere (on local machine, remote or 3rd party)

Jaxx (mobile wallet)
Metamask (browser wallet)
