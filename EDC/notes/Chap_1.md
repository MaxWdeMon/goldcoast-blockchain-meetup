CHAPTER 1
==========
Ethereum is an open source, globally decentralized computing infrastructure that executes programs called smart contracts. It uses a blockchain to synchronize and store the systemâ€™s state changes, along with a cryptocurrency called ether to meter and constrain execution resource costs.

30 July 2015 first Ethereum block was mined.

Ethereum also tracks state of general purpose data store instead of just currency.

Turing complete.

Gas will stop contract running forever (Turing complete computation) when node attempts to validate it.
