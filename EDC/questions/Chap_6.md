Produce an RLP Encoded Serialized message of TX Data Structure<br> 
Compute the Keccak 256 hash of Serialized message<br>
Append the ECDSA signatures computed v,r & s values to the transaction<br>
Create a TX Data Structure<br>
Sign the hash with the EOA's private key<br>

Q. Select all possible answers. If there is value but no data in your transaction to a valid contract address, the EVM will

2. Increase the ether balance of the contract where none exists<br>

4. Call the constructor<br>
<br>
Q. If you transmit a transaction with nonce 0 and then transmit a transaction with nonce 2. The second transaction will be <br>

2. It will be stored in the mempool<br>
3. It will be rejected<br>
4. It will be mined after the next block<br>
